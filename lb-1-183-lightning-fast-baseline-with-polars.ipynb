Dual time-weighted center of charge: A simple way to calculate best fit line using all 5 dimensions (x,y,z,time,charge): see Section 1. **LB 1.214**. Train Batch 1: 1.21728. <br>\n b. Similarly: SolverWorld discusses [here][1] and implements [here][2] a least squares algorithm using 4 dimensions (x,y,z,time): LB 1.214. Train Batch 1: 1.21724. <br>\n c. UPDATE: It turns out that this least squares formula is **exactly** equivalent to the time-weighted formula for #1, unweighted by 'charge'. After applying a weighted version of the least squares algorithm, it gets exactly the same results as my separately derived formula. I keep both variants in my notebook to summarize and compare. And the high-level description of each is very different, even though the formula ends up identical.\n2. Find best points: a baseline method for labeling auxiliary column ourselves. I first discussed this concept [here][3], and will explain more about this strategy in Section 2. **LB 1.184**. Train Batch 1: 1.18865.\n3. Ensemble of charge weighted and unweighted: **LB 1.183**. Train Batch 1: 1.18753.\n4. Small optimization on top of #2: use 1/100th weight for aux=False points not selected with 'best points' algorithm. **LB 1.182??**. Train Batch 1: 1.18623.\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. Avoid for loops or groupby-apply where possible. Gets the 1.214 baseline from around 1 hour to about 2 minutes, a 30x improvement. Note: All times are in terms of submitting and scoring a notebook against the full test dataset. Highlighted in Section 1.\n2. To optimize labeling auxiliary columns, use pure numpy with minimized input/output data size for the unfortunate 'for each event' part. Gets the 1.184 baseline from ~ an hour to about 8 minutes, a 6x improvement. Part of Section 2.\n3. Try using Polars instead of Pandas! This is my first time using it, please join me in exploring what it can do! See Section 3. Gets the 1.214 baseline from about 120 seconds to about 100 seconds, even with a 35 second pip install cost. So about 2x faster. No real improvement, though, on overall execution time when finding best points, still about 8 minutes.\n\n# Credits\nThanks to many Kagglers who have shared ideas. I shamelessly stole the Notebook intro formatting from cdeotte - for example [here][4]. As credited above, SolverWorld for summarizing and highlighting the least squares algorithm, which I added for both comparison and for ensembling. And many people contributed to my understanding of the physics of IceCube neutrino detection.\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icecube-neutrinos-in-deep-ice/discussion/381747\n[2]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/solverworld/icecube-neutrino-path-least-squares-1-214\n[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icecube-neutrinos-in-deep-ice/discussion/379677\n[4]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/candidate-rerank-model-lb-0-575","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009057,"end_time":"2023-02-01T01:12:08.196470","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-01T01:12:08.187413","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>\n\n# Notes\nBelow are notes about versions:\n* **Version 1: LB 1.214** Baseline LB submit for center of charge algorithm.

We could do a naive technique like first half vs last half, but in reality we want to treat all time gaps as equal relative to the length of the time gap. So we can normalize all timestamps as 0 to 1 (0 is earliest to 1 as latest) or the inverse 1 to 0 (1 is earliest).

This is just a baseline algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm with current parameters: Check the nearest 3 sensors above and 3 below, for any hits within 350ns of the hit. In current algorithm, it has to be a hit on the neighbor, a second hit on the same sensor within 375ns is not sufficient. For Deep Ice strings, check only the nearest sensor above and below within 180ns.\n\nIn early drafts, I tried calculating pure distance (which can be precomputed for a 5620x5620 sensor matrix). However, the early results showed an optimal distance well under the minimum xy distance separating strings. Which after reading a bunch of discussions and IceCube overviews, did NOT surprise me. So I simplified to simply using vertical neighbors and seeing how many is optimal. And likewise tuning how far apart to set the optimal max time delta. 1000ns is probably too long, if you are mainly using adjacent sensors that logically SHOULD both trigger for the high energy events you are looking for.\n\nOf course, future work can include a hugely stratified event characterization, so that we use different hyperparameters for 'best points' based on factors like total observed charge and/or number of rows, and other factors. Possibly stratified for 'edge' strings vs 'inner' strings. Another to-do that should see big gains is to use fuzzy logic, not binary logic. Convert this to a (sigmoidal?) likelihood algorithm and use the result as weights instead of just 'yes' vs 'no' binary weighting.\n\nDeep ice strings are NOT symmetric compared with the other strings! My 'center of charge' algorithm relies on symmetry. Current solution to that is to use different parameters that only take the highest quality points. It's more of a compromise than a solution to this particular issue. There might be some corner case math or other trick that could do a better job of preventing anti-symmetry bias from reducing the accuracy of the final prediction.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007639,"end_time":"2023-02-01T01:12:42.552433","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-01T01:12:42.544794","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def proximity(e, col):\n    ## Since we explode the data to an NxN array, if N is too high it will take a long time and anyways we'll run out of memory.\n    ## TODO: see how high we can go before we run out of memory\n    ## TODO: consider subsampling instead of simply returning the baseline auxiliary setting?\n    ##       And/or splitting on string_id to get much smaller groups\n    if e.shape[0] > 2000:\n        return e[:, col['auxiliary']]\n\n    ## The magic None in the line below is a new thing I learned while working on this notebook.\n    ## It is shorthand for np.newaxis, and broadcasts the array to another dimension.\n    ## This allows us to create an NxN array for each event, so that we can\n    ## check if *any* other row in the event meets our proximity in time and height requirements.\n    ## For any matching pairs, then we set both rows as auxiliary = False.
